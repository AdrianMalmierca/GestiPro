## Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized enterprises (PMEs) in France frequently need internal management tools to handle team members, assign permissions, and manage access levels — yet most off-the-shelf solutions are either too complex or not localized for multilingual teams.

GestiPro solves this by providing a clean, lightweight, self-hostable dashboard that:
- Enforces role-based access so admins control what users can see and do
- Supports three languages out of the box, making it suitable for international teams
- Demonstrates a complete authentication and authorization flow using modern web standards

### Users
Full user table with role badges, avatar initials, and role filter. Admins can promote/demote any user except themselves.

## Features

### Authentication
- Secure sign-in and registration with email and password
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Sessions managed via JWT — no database sessions needed
- Protected routes via Next.js middleware — unauthenticated users are redirected to login

### Role-Based Access Control
- Two roles: **ADMIN** and **USER**
- Admin-only pages are protected at three independent levels: middleware, server component, and UI
- Admins can promote/demote users directly from the Users table
- Admins cannot change their own role
- Non-admin users cannot see the Admin Zone in the sidebar or navigate to it

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Three languages: French 🇫🇷, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸
- Language switcher in the top navigation bar, in Settings, and on the login/register pages
- Locale-prefixed URLs: `/fr/dashboard`, `/en/users`, `/es/settings`
- All UI text, labels, dates, and dynamic content are fully translated
- Built with `next-intl` v4 using the App Router pattern with `setRequestLocale`

### Pages
- **Dashboard** — real-time metrics from the database, activity feed, session chart, user access card
- **Users** — user table with role badges, filter by role, change role (admin only)
- **Admin Zone** — restricted panel with advanced stats, role distribution chart, and activity log
- **Settings** — personal info editor, language selector, account information card

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AdrianMalmierca/gestipro.git
cd gestipro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, and NEXTAUTH_URL

# Generate Prisma client and run migrations
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — it redirects to `/fr/login`.

### Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"                     # SQLite for local dev
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-min-32-chars"       # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Server vs Client Components
Pages and layouts are Server Components by default — they fetch data and render HTML on the server. Only interactive parts (forms, tables with state, the language switcher) are Client Components. Translations are fetched server-side with `getTranslations()` and passed as props to client components, avoiding provider context issues.

### Middleware Strategy
A single `middleware.ts` handles both i18n routing (via `next-intl`) and authentication (via `next-auth/jwt`). Public pages (login, register) bypass auth and go straight to the intl middleware. Protected pages check for a valid JWT first, then fall through to locale detection.

### Role Protection at Multiple Levels
Roles are enforced at three independent layers:
1. **Middleware** — redirects unauthenticated users before the page renders
2. **Server Component** — `admin/page.tsx` redirects non-admins server-side
3. **UI** — the sidebar only renders the Admin Zone link for ADMIN users

### i18n with setRequestLocale
Each page receives `params.locale` from the dynamic route segment and calls `setRequestLocale(locale)` before any translations are loaded. This ensures `getTranslations()` always resolves to the correct locale, even when navigating between pages without a full reload.

## API Routes

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/callback/credentials` | Public | NextAuth sign-in |
| GET | `/api/auth/session` | Public | Get current session |
| POST | `/api/register` | Public | Create new user account |
| PATCH | `/api/users/role` | ADMIN only | Update a user's role |

---

## Future Improvements

### Short Term
- **Password change** — allow users to update their password from Settings
- **User deactivation** — soft-delete users instead of permanent removal
- **Toast notifications** — visual feedback on role changes and settings saves
- **Form validation** — password strength indicator on register

### Medium Term
- **Audit log** — persist real admin actions to the database instead of static mock data
- **Email verification** — verify email address on registration with a confirmation link
- **OAuth providers** — add Google / GitHub sign-in via NextAuth
- **Dark mode** — system-preference-aware dark theme

### Long Term
- **Multi-tenancy** — support multiple organizations with isolated data
- **RBAC expansion** — granular permissions beyond ADMIN/USER (e.g., MANAGER, VIEWER)
- **Metrics persistence** — store daily session counts in the database for real chart data
- **Export functionality** — CSV/PDF export of user lists and activity logs

## What I Learned Building This

### Next.js App Router Patterns
Working with the App Router forced me to think clearly about the boundary between Server and Client Components. The key insight: fetch data server-side and pass it as props to client components that need interactivity — rather than fetching everything on the client and dealing with loading states and waterfalls.

### i18n Complexity in SSR
Internationalization in a full-stack SSR app is significantly more complex than in a SPA. The main challenge was ensuring `setRequestLocale` was called in every page component receiving `params`, not just in the root layout. Without this, `getTranslations()` silently falls back to the default locale regardless of the URL.

### Prisma Version Compatibility
During development I encountered significant breaking changes between Prisma v5 and v7 — particularly around enum support in SQLite and the new `prisma.config.ts` pattern introduced in v7. This reinforced the importance of pinning dependency versions and reading changelogs carefully before upgrading.

### Middleware Composition
Combining two middleware libraries (next-intl and next-auth) in a single `middleware.ts` requires careful ordering. The auth check must happen before i18n processing for protected routes, but i18n must run first on public routes to detect the locale for redirect URLs.

### JWT Session Extension
Extending NextAuth's session type with custom fields (role, id) requires both runtime callbacks in `auth.ts` and TypeScript declaration merging in `next-auth.d.ts`. Getting this right across `jwt()` and `session()` callbacks was a key learning about how NextAuth's dual runtime/type system works.
